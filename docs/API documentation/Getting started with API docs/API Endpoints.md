Each endpoint article in your API documentation workspace comes with a set of options for adding custom content, configuring article settings, collaborating with your team, and controlling access. This article covers everything available on an endpoint article page.

## Adding custom content to endpoint articles

You can add and format custom content directly within your API endpoint pages using the built-in editor. This is useful for adding usage notes, code examples, or context that is not captured in your OpenAPI spec.

To add content to an endpoint page:

1. Navigate to **API documentation ({ })** in the left navigation bar.
2. Open the endpoint article you want to edit.
3. Click the **(+)** icon to insert an editor block below the spec-generated content.
4. Enter your content and format it using the toolbar options.

Your content is saved automatically. Any custom content you add is retained when you regenerate or resync your API documentation.

### Editor toolbar

The endpoint article editor supports basic formatting options - **Bold**, **Italic**, and **Underline**, along with the ability to insert a **Link**, attach a **File**, or embed an **Image**. These options are available in the toolbar at the top of the editor block.
